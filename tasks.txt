MISSION
===

mission:  I want to go throw a list of people I follow, view a bunch of custom indicators about that person, and then unfollow that person.
  indicators:
    - people who follow them
    - number of people who follow them total
      - #1 / #2 ?
    - number of people they follow
    - follow ratio
    - bio
    - LAST TWEET LIKED/RETWEETED
    - website
    - mutuals?
    - last 5 (?) tweets from that person
      - maybe *best* last 5 tweets from that person?
    - tweet frequency (tweets / day)
    - people they follow
    - most frequent hashtags in last (30 days?)
    - time of following
    - tweet you liked/retweeted/commented-on before following?
    - number of liked/retweeted/commented-on tweets

  ui:
    - make it like twitter's current UI, but better (?)
    - snappy UI functionality (show off ember)
    - queue unfollows!

  research:
